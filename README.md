#Skills Page
The Skills page was completed in order to showcase additional skills that may or may not be clear on the CV. Ideally the CV will be the first point a user.
For now MUI accordion parent element is then split into lists for headings then a short description of all except Software as this will be broken down in the future.
Each Accordion is subject to change as the categories are just rough ideas.

#Projects Page
As yet this is still undecided on execution whether screenshot on subpages with links to project pages or just links to project pages etc. Multiple design requirements still to be determined.

##Changes from Ed Roh
Deleted Dashboard and related aspects.
Deleted pages that were not required
Included pages relevant to my requirements - Homepage, Skills, Work Experience and Contact.
Included page features relevant to my requirements - Individual accordions have helped to section off information in the same way an CV can be split.
